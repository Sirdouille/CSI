CSI Fadeport 8 mst and zon files

Here are modifications to the JanFeld mst and zone files (https://github.com/JanFeld/reaper-csi-configs) to suit my needs.

Most of my modifications concern the FP8s1_Buttons files. I changed a few things in the mst file as well, mainly for the lighting behaviour of the buttons. I didn't make much use of the Zones. I used a lot of modifiers instead.

I didn't get the Encoder function to work with the knobs (RotaryBig and RotarySmall), so I went back to the fastidious but straightforward defintion from Airon (see mst file)

The upper left small knob is used for navigation through tracks, I find it more intuitive.
